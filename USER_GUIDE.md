This is some description on how to go through the code and understand it, and how you can compile and use the 'engine' yourself (Thought I'm not sure why you would do that).

Compilation: 
  1. Just clone the repository and run ```make``` on the terminal in the project directory. You will have to install make tools for this though.
  2. Make sure to maintain the directory structure because teh ```makefile``` uses it to access files and place built files.
